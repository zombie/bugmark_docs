XXVIII. And these your professed politicians, the only true
practical philosophers of the world, (as they think of
themselves) so full of affected gravity, or such professed
lovers of virtue and honesty, what wretches be they in very
deed; how vile and contemptible in themselves? O man! what
ado doest thou keep? Do what thy nature doth now require.
Resolve upon it, if thou mayest: and take no thought,
whether anybody shall know it or no. Yea, <b>but</b> sayest
thou, I must not expect a Plato's commonwealth. If they
profit though never <b>so</b> little, I must be content; and
think much even of that little progress. Doth then any of
them forsake their former false opinions that I should think
they profit? For without a change of opinions, alas! what is
all that ostentation, but mere wretchedness of slavish
minds, that groan privately, and yet would make a show of
obedience <b>to</b> reason, and truth? Go too now and tell
me of Alexander and Philippus, and Demetrius Phalereus.
Whether they understood what the common nature requireth,
and could rule themselves or no, they know best themselves.
But if they kept a life, and swaggered; I (God be thanked)
am not bound to imitate them. The effect of true philosophy
is, unaffected simplicity and modesty. Persuade me not to
ostentation and vainglory.
