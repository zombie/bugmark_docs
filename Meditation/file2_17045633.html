XXXVIII. Even as if any of the gods should tell thee, Thou
shalt certainly die to-morrow, or next day, thou wouldst
not, except thou wert extremely base and pusillanimous, take
it for a great <b>benefit,</b> rather to die the next day
after, than to-morrow; (for alas, what is the
<b>difference!)</b> so, for the same reason, think it
<b>no</b> great matter to die rather many years after, than
the very next day.
