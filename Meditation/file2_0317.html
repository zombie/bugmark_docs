XXV. How hast thou carried thyself hitherto towards the
Gods? towards thy parents? towards thy brethren? towards thy
wife? towards thy children? towards thy masters? thy
foster-fathers? thy friends? thy domestics? thy servants? Is
<b>it</b> so with thee, that hitherto thou hast neither by
word or deed wronged any of them? Remember withal through
how many things thou hast already passed, and how many thou
hast been able to endure; so that now the <b>legend</b> of
thy life is full, and thy charge is accomplished. Again, how
many truly good things have certainly by thee been
discerned? how many <b>pleasures,</b> how many pains hast
thou passed over with contempt? how many things eternally
glorious hast thou despised? towards how many perverse
unreasonable men hast thou carried thyself kindly, and
discreetly?
