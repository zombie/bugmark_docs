VII. From Alexander the Grammarian, to be un-reprovable
myself, and not reproachfully to reprehend any man for a
barbarism, or a solecism, or any false pronunciation, but
dextrously by way of answer, or <b>testimony,</b> or
confirmation of the same matter <b>(taking</b> no notice of
the word) to utter it as it should have been spoken; or by
some other such close and indirect admonition, handsomely
and civilly to tell him of <b>it.</b>
