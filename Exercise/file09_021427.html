I. A man must not only consider how daily his life wasteth
and decreaseth, but this also, that if he live long, he
cannot be certain, whether his understanding shall continue
so able and sufficient, for either discreet consideration,
in matter of businesses; or for contemplation: <b>it</b>
being the thing, whereon true knowledge of things both
divine and human, doth depend. For if once he shall begin to
dote, his respiration, nutrition, his imaginative, and
appetitive, and other natural faculties, may still continue
the same: he shall find no want of them. But how to make
that right use of himself that he should, how to observe
exactly in all things that which is right and just, how to
redress and rectify all wrong, or sudden apprehensions and
imaginations, and even of this particular, whether he should
live any longer or no, to consider duly; for all such
things, <b>wherein</b> the best strength and vigour of the
mind is most requisite; his power and ability will be past
and gone. Thou must hasten therefore; not only because thou
art every day nearer unto death than other, but also because
that <b>intellective</b> <b>faculty</b> in thee, whereby
thou art enabled to know the <b>true</b> nature of things,
and to order all thy actions by that knowledge, doth daily
waste and decay: or, may fail thee before thou die.
