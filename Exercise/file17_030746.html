VIII. Whatsoever thou dost affect, whatsoever thou dost
project, so do, and so project <b>all,</b> as one who, for
aught thou knowest, may at this very present depart out of
this life. And as for death, if there be any gods, it is no
grievous thing to leave the society of men. The gods will do
thee no hurt, thou mayest be sure. But if it be so that
there be no gods, or that they take no care of the world,
why should I <b>desire</b> to live in a world void of gods,
and of all divine providence? But gods there be certainly,
and they take care for the world; and as for those things
which be truly evil, as vice and wickedness, such things
they have put in a man's own power, that he might avoid them
if he would: and had there been anything besides that had
been truly bad and evil, they would have had a care of that
also, that a man might have avoided it. But why should that
be thought to hurt and prejudice a man's life in this world,
which cannot any ways make man himself the better, or the
worse in his own person? Neither must we think that the
nature of <b>the</b> universe did either through ignorance
pass these things, or if not as ignorant of them, yet as
unable either to prevent, or better to order and dispose
them. It cannot be <b>that</b> she through want either of
power or skill, should have committed such a thing, so as to
suffer all things both good and bad, equally and
promiscuously, to happen unto all both good and bad. As for
life therefore, and death, honour and dishonour, labour and
pleasure, riches and poverty, all <b>these</b> things happen
unto men indeed, both good and bad, equally; but as things
which of themselves are neither good nor bad; because of
themselves, neither shameful nor praiseworthy.
