II. A pleasant song or dance; the Pancratiast's exercise,
sports that thou art wont to be much taken with, thou shalt
easily contemn; if the harmonious voice thou shalt divide
into so many particular sounds whereof it doth consist, and
of every one in particular shall ask thyself; whether this
or that sound is it, that doth so conquer thee. For thou
wilt be <b>ashamed</b> of it. And so for shame, if
accordingly thou shalt consider it, every <b>particular</b>
motion and posture by <b>itself:</b> and so for the
wrestler's exercise too. Generally then, whatsoever it be,
besides virtue, and those things that proceed from virtue
that thou <b>art</b> subject to be much affected with,
remember presently thus to divide <b>it,</b> and by this
kind of division, in each particular to attain unto the
contempt of the whole. This thou must transfer and apply to
thy whole life also.
