VIII. Whatsoever doth happen in the world, doth happen
justly, and so if <b>thou</b> dost well take <b>heed,</b>
thou shalt find it. I say not only in right order by a
series of inevitable consequences, but <b>according</b> to
justice and as it were by way of equal distribution,
according to the true worth of everything. Continue then
<b>to</b> take notice of it, as thou hast begun, and
whatsoever thou dost, do it not without this proviso, that
it be a thing of that nature that a good man (as the word
good is properly taken) may do it. <b>This</b> observe
carefully in every action.
