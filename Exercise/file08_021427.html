XIII. What use is there of suspicion at all? or, why should
thoughts of mistrust, and suspicion concerning that which is
future, trouble thy mind at all? <b>What</b> now is to be
done, if thou <b>mayest</b> search and inquiry into that,
what needs thou care for more? And if thou <b>art</b> well
able to perceive it alone, let no man divert thee from it.
But if alone thou doest not so well perceive it, suspend
thine action, and take advice from the best. And if there be
<b>anything</b> else that doth hinder thee, go on with
prudence and discretion, according to the present occasion
and opportunity, still proposing that unto thyself, which
thou doest conceive most right and just. For to hit that
aright, and to speed in the prosecution of it, must needs be
happiness, since it is that only which we can truly and
properly be said to <b>miss</b> of, or miscarry in.
