IV. If to <b>understand</b> and to be reasonable be
<b>common</b> unto all men, then is that reason, for which
we are termed reasonable, common unto all. If reason is
general, then is that reason also, which prescribeth what is
to be done and what not, common unto all. If that, then law.
If law, then are we fellow-citizens. If so, then are we
partners in <b>some</b> one commonweal. If so, then the
world is as it were a city. For which <b>other</b>
commonweal is it, that all men can be said to be members of?
From this common city it is, that understanding, reason, and
law is derived unto us, for from whence else? For as that
which in me is earthly I have from some common earth; and
that which is moist from some other element is imparted; as
my breath and life hath its proper fountain; and that
<b>likewise</b> which is dry and fiery in me: (for there is
nothing which doth not proceed from something; as also there
is nothing that can be reduced unto mere nothing:) so also
is there some common beginning from whence my understanding
hath proceeded.
