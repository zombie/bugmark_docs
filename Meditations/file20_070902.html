XXIV. Lucilla buried Verus; then was Lucilla herself buried
by others. <b>So</b> Secunda Maximus, then Secunda herself.
So Epitynchanus, Diotimus; then Epitynchanus himself. So
<b>Antoninus</b> Pius, Faustina his wife; then Antoninus
himself. This is the course of the world. First Celer,
Adrianus; then Adrianus himself. And those austere ones;
those that foretold other men's deaths; those that were so
proud and stately, <b>where</b> are they now? Those austere
ones I mean, such as were <b>Charax,</b> and Demetrius the
Platonic, and Eudaemon, and others like unto those. They
were all but for one day; all dead and gone long since. Some
of them no sooner dead, than forgotten. Others soon turned
into fables. Of others, even that which was <b>fabulous,</b>
is now long since forgotten. This thereafter thou must
remember, that whatsoever thou art compounded of, shall soon
be dispersed, and that thy life and breath, or thy soul,
shall either be no more or shall ranslated (sp.), and
appointed to some certain place and station.
