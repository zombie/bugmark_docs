XXV. The true joy of a man, is to do that which properly
belongs unto a man. That which is most proper unto a man,
is, first, to be kindly affected towards them that are of
the <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> and nature as he is himself
<b>to</b> <b>contemn</b> all sensual motions and appetites,
to discern rightly all plausible fancies and imaginations,
to contemplate the nature <b>of</b> the universe; both it,
and things that are done in it. In which kind of
contemplation three several relations are to be observed The
first, to the apparent secondary cause. The Second to the
first original cause, God, from whom originally proceeds
whatsoever doth happen in the world. The third and last, to
them that we live and converse with: what use may be made of
it, to their use and benefit.
