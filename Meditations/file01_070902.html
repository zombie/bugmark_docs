XXXIII. Let it not be in any man's power, to say truly of
thee, that thou art not truly simple, or sincere and open,
or not good. Let him be deceived whosoever he be that shall
have any such opinion of thee. For all this doth depend of
thee. For who is it that should hinder thee from being
either truly simple or good? Do thou only resolve rather not
to live, than not to be such. For indeed neither doth it
stand with reason that he should live that is not such. What
then is it that may upon this present occasion according to
best reason and discretion, either be said or done? For
whatsoever it be, it is in thy power either to do it, or to
say it, and therefore seek not any pretences, as though thou
wert hindered. Thou wilt never cease groaning and
complaining, until such time as that, what pleasure is unto
the voluptuous, be unto thee, to <b>do</b> in everything
that presents itself, whatsoever may be <b>done</b>
conformably and agreeably to the proper constitution of man,
or, to man as he is a man. For thou must account that
pleasure, whatsoever it be, that thou mayest do according to
thine own nature. And to do this, every place will fit thee.
Unto the cylindrus, or roller, it is not granted to move
everywhere according to its own proper motion, as neither
unto the water, nor unto the fire, nor unto any other thing,
that either is merely natural, or natural and sensitive; but
not rational for many things there be <b>that</b> can hinder
<b>their</b> operations. But of the mind and understanding
this is the proper privilege, that according to its own
nature, and as it will itself, it can pass through every
obstacle that it finds, and keep straight on forwards.
Setting therefore before thine eyes this happiness and
felicity of thy mind, whereby it is able to pass through all
things, and is capable of all motions, whether as the fire,
upwards; or as the stone downwards, or as the cylindrus
through that which is sloping: content thyself with it, and
seek not after any other thing. For all other kind of
hindrances that are not hindrances of thy mind either they
are proper to the <b>body,</b> or merely proceed from the
opinion, reason not making that resistance that it should,
but basely, and cowardly suffering itself to be foiled; and
of themselves can neither wound, nor do any hurt at all.
Else must he of necessity, whosoever he be that meets with
any of them, become worse than he was before. For so is it
in all other subjects, that that is thought hurtful unto
them, whereby they are made worse. But here contrariwise,
man (if he make that good use of them that he should) is
rather the better and the more praiseworthy for any of those
kind of hindrances, than otherwise. But generally remember
that nothing can hurt a natural citizen, that is not hurtful
unto the city itself, nor anything hurt the city, that is
not hurtful unto the law itself. But none of these
casualties, or external hindrances, do hurt the law itself;
or, are contrary to that course of justice and equity, by
which public societies are maintained: neither therefore do
they hurt either city or citizen.
