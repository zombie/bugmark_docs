XXVIII. Those words which once were common and ordinary, are
now become obscure and obsolete; and so the names <b>of</b>
men once commonly known and famous, are now become in a
manner obscure <b>and</b> obsolete names. Camillus, Cieso,
Volesius, Leonnatus; not long after, Scipio, Cato, then
Augustus, then Adrianus, then Antoninus Pius: all these in a
short time will be out of date, and, as things of another
world as it were, become fabulous. And this I say of them,
who once shined as the wonders of their ages, for as for the
rest, no sooner are they expired, than with them all their
fame and memory. And what is it then that shall always be
remembered? all is vanity. What is it that we must bestow
our care and diligence upon? even upon <b>this</b> only:
that our minds and wills be just; <b>that</b> our actions be
charitable; that our speech be never deceitful, or that our
understanding be not subject to error; that our inclination
be always set to embrace whatsoever shall happen unto us, as
necessary, as usual, as ordinary, as flowing from such a
<b>beginning,</b> and such a fountain, from which both thou
thyself and all things are. Willingly therefore, and wholly
surrender up thyself unto that fatal concatenation, yielding
up thyself unto the fates, to be disposed of at their
pleasure.
