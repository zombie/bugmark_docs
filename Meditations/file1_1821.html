XXIV. What doest thou desire? To live long. What? To enjoy
the operations of a sensitive soul; or of the appetitive
faculty? or wouldst thou grow, and then decrease again?
Wouldst thou long be able to talk, to think and reason with
<b>thyself?</b> Which of all these seems unto thee a worthy
object of <b>thy</b> <b>desire?</b> Now if of all these thou
doest find that they be but <b>little</b> worth in
themselves, proceed on unto the last, which is, in all
things <b>to</b> follow God and reason. But for a man to
grieve that by death he shall be deprived of any of these
things, is both against God and reason.
