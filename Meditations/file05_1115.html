XVII. If so be that the souls remain after death (say they
that will not believe it); how is the air from all eternity
able to contain them? How is the earth (say I) ever from
that time able to Contain the bodies of them that are
buried? For as here the change and resolution of dead bodies
into another kind of subsistence (whatsoever it be;) makes
place for other dead bodies: so the souls after death
transferred into the air, after they have conversed there a
while, are either by way of transmutation, or transfusion,
or conflagration, received again into that original rational
substance, from which all others do proceed: and so give way
to those souls, who before coupled and associated unto
bodies, now begin to subsist single. This, upon a
supposition <b>that</b> the souls after death do for a while
subsist single, may be answered. And here, (besides the
number of bodies, so buried and contained by the earth), we
may further consider the <b>number</b> of several beasts,
eaten by us men, and by <b>other</b> creatures. For
<b>notwithstanding</b> that such a multitude of them is
daily consumed, and as it were buried in the bodies of the
eaters, yet is the same place and body able to contain them,
<b>by</b> reason of their conversion, partly into blood,
partly into air and fire. What in these things is the
speculation of truth? to divide things into that which is
passive and material; and that which is active and formal.
