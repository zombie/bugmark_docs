III. That <b>which</b> most men would think themselves most
happy for, and would prefer before all things, if the Gods
would grant it unto them after their deaths, thou mayst
whilst thou livest grant unto thyself; to live again. See
the things of the world again, as thou hast already seen
them. For what is <b>it</b> else to live again? Public shows
and solemnities with much pomp and vanity, stage plays,
flocks and herds; conflicts and contentions: a bone thrown
to a company of <b>hungry</b> curs; a bait for greedy
fishes; the painfulness, and continual burden-bearing of
wretched ants, the running to and fro of terrified mice:
little puppets drawn up and down with wires and nerves:
these be the objects of the world among all <b>these</b>
thou must stand steadfast, meekly affected, and free from
all manner of indignation; with this right ratiocination and
apprehension; that as the <b>worth</b> is of those things
which a man doth affect, so is in very deed every man's
worth more or less.
