XIV. How rotten and insincere is he, that saith, I am
resolved to carry myself hereafter towards <b>you</b> with
all ingenuity and simplicity. O man, what doest thou mean!
what needs this profession of thine? the thing itself will
show it. It ought to be written upon thy forehead. No sooner
thy voice is heard, than thy countenance must be able to
show what <b>is</b> in thy mind: even as he that is loved
knows presently by the looks of his sweetheart what is in
her mind. Such must he be for all the world, that is truly
simple and good, as he whose arm-holes are offensive, that
whosoever stands by, as soon as ever he comes near him, may
as it were smell him whether he will or no. <b>But</b> the
affectation of simplicity is nowise laudable. There is
nothing <b>more</b> shameful than perfidious friendship.
Above all things, that must be avoided. However true
goodness, simplicity, and kindness cannot so be hidden, but
that as we have already said in the very eyes <b>and</b>
countenance they will show themselves.
