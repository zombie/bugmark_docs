IX. Be not discontented, be not disheartened, be not out of
hope, if often it succeed not so well with thee punctually
and precisely to do all things according to the right
dogmata, but being once cast off, return unto them again:
and as for those many and more frequent occurrences, either
of worldly distractions, or human infirmities, which as a
man thou canst not but in some measure be subject unto, be
not thou discontented with them; but however, love and
affect that only which thou dust return unto: a
philosopher's life, and proper occupation after the most
exact manner. And when thou dust return to thy philosophy,
return not unto it as the manner of some is, after play and
liberty as it were, to their schoolmasters and pedagogues;
but as they that have sore eyes to their sponge and egg: or
as another to his cataplasm; or as others to their
fomentations: so shalt not thou make it a matter of
ostentation at all to obey reason but of ease and comfort.
And remember that philosophy requireth nothing of thee, but
what thy nature requireth, and wouldest thou thyself desire
anything that is not according to nature? for which of these
sayest thou; that which is according to nature or against
it, is of itself more kind and pleasing? <b>Is</b> it not
for that respect <b>especially,</b> that pleasure itself is
to so many men's hurt and overthrow, most prevalent, because
esteemed commonly most kind, and natural? But consider well
whether magnanimity rather, and true liberty, and true
simplicity, and equanimity, and holiness; whether these be
not most kind and natural? And prudency itself, what more
kind and amiable than it, when thou shalt truly consider
with thyself, what it is through all the proper objects of
thy rational intellectual faculty currently to go on without
any fall or stumble? As for the things of the world, their
true nature is in a manner so involved with obscurity, that
unto many philosophers, and those no mean ones, they seemed
altogether incomprehensible, and the Stoics themselves,
though they judge them not altogether incomprehensible, yet
scarce and not <b>without</b> much difficulty,
comprehensible, so that all assent of ours is fallible, for
who is he that is infallible in his conclusions? From the
nature of things, pass now unto their subjects and matter:
<b>how</b> temporary, how vile are they I such as may be in
the power and possession of some abominable loose liver, of
some common strumpet, of some notorious oppressor and
extortioner. Pass from thence to the dispositions of them
that thou doest ordinarily converse with, how hardly do we
bear, even with the most loving and amiable! that I may not
say, how hard <b>it</b> is for us to bear even with our own
selves, in such obscurity, and impurity of things: in such
and so continual a flux both of the substances and time;
both of the motions themselves, and things moved; what it is
that we can fasten upon; either to honour, and respect
especially; or seriously, and studiously to seek after; I
cannot so much as conceive For indeed they are things
contrary.
