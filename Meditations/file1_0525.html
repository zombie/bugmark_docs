XIX. Of an operation and of a purpose there is an ending, or
of an <b>action</b> and of a purpose we say commonly, that
it is at an end: from opinion also there is an absolute
cessation, which is as it were the death of it. In all this
there is no hurt. Apply this now to a man's age, as first, a
child; then a youth, then a young man, then an old man;
every change from one age to another <b>is</b> a kind of
death <b>And</b> all this while here no matter of grief yet.
Pass now unto that life first, that which thou livedst under
thy grandfather, then under thy mother, then under thy
father. And thus when through the whole <b>course</b> of thy
life hitherto thou hast found and observed many alterations,
many changes, many kinds of endings and cessations, put this
question to thyself What matter <b>of</b> grief or sorrow
dost thou find in any of these? Or what doest thou suffer
through any of these? If in none of these, then neither in
the ending and consummation of thy whole life, which is also
but a cessation and change.
