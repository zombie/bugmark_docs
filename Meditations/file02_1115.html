XXIX. From some high place as it were to look down, and to
behold here flocks, and there sacrifices, without number;
and all kind of navigation; some in a rough and stormy sea,
and some in a calm: the general differences, or different
estates of things, some, that are now first upon being; the
several and mutual relations of those things that are
together; and some other things that are at their last.
Their lives also, who were long ago, and theirs who shall be
hereafter, and the present <b>estate</b> and life of those
many nations of barbarians that are now in the world, thou
must likewise consider in thy mind. And how many there be,
who never so much as <b>heard</b> of thy name, how many that
will soon forget it; how many who but even now did commend
thee, within a very little while perchance <b>will</b> speak
ill of thee. So that neither fame, nor honour, nor anything
else that this world doth afford, is worth the while. The
sum then of all; whatsoever doth happen unto thee, whereof
God is the cause, to accept it contentedly: whatsoever thou
doest, whereof thou thyself art the cause, to do <b>it</b>
justly: which will be, if both in thy resolution and in
<b>thy</b> action thou have no further end, than to do good
unto others, as being that, which by thy natural
constitution, as a man, thou art bound unto.
